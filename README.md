# DevFolio-React

DevFolio-React is based on a free HTML based template [DevFolio](https://bootstrapmade.com/devfolio-bootstrap-portfolio-html-template/).
The idea behind this project is to turn this static portfolio into a full-fledge open source database driven portfolio which anyone can use and setup thei personal profile without any hassle.

## Current Version

As a first step, the static HTML based portfolio has been converted into a ReactJS based single page app with client side routing. 

## Next Steps
I will keep working on this as a hobby project and would turn it into a data driven portfolio - which is open source and anyone can benefit from it. Contributions are always welcome :)
