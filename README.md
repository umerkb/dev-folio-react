# DevFolio-React

DevFolio-React is based on a free HTML template [DevFolio](https://bootstrapmade.com/devfolio-bootstrap-portfolio-html-template/).
The idea behind this project is to turn this static portfolio into a full-fledge open source dynamic portfolio which anyone can use and setup their personal profile without any hassle.

## Current Version

As a first step, the static HTML based portfolio has been converted into a dynamic ReactJS based single page app with client side routing. 

### Front End: ReactJS
### Backend: Google Firestore


## Next Steps
I will keep working on this as a hobby project and would turn it into a data driven portfolio - which is open source and anyone can benefit from it. Contributions are always welcome :) 

Roadmap:

1. Add Google Firestore Authentication
2. Implement Login/Logout functionality
3. Create Protected Routes
4. Implement Admin screen to add/edit profile data
5. Implement User Registration / signup 
6. user/sub-domain mapping
7. segregating data per user
8. user specific sessions
